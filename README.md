Task 01 is all about understanding C# Basic and applying them for a mini project.

Btn OK is to start showing the right side that contains empty text area.
Btn Up will start by building a pyramid of stars, start point of it starting from top.
Btn right will destroy the pyramid from up till down then rebuild it, start point this time will be starting from the right side.
Btn left will do the same as Btn right, but at the building time start point will be starting from left side.
Btn down will be like left and right but this time starting point will be down.
Note: expectation of clicking on Up button after any other button is to do the same behavior as the rest of buttons.
- While building Task 01 you need to follow OOP.
